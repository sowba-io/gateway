# Sowba Federated OpenAPI Gateway

Sowba Gateway is a federated OpenAPI Gateway.

The main goal of this project is to empower microservice developers to
build domain driven services build cohesive decoupled REST microserver APIs.

The project is heavily influenced by [Apollo's GraphQL gateway](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/)
but for REST services. Also, as long as your service speaks JSON, you can provide
OpenAPI specs for it and use it here so it can easily work with legacy REST systems.
